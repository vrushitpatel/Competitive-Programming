# ðŸ“Œ Python Booleans

## Overview
Booleans represent one of two values: `True` or `False`.
In programming you often need to know if an expression is `True` or `False`.

You can evaluate any expression in Python, and get one of two answers, `True` or `False`.

When you compare two values, the expression is evaluated and Python returns the Boolean answer:
```python
print(10 > 9) # True
print(10 == 9) # False
print(10 < 9) # False
```

When you run a condition in an if statement, Python returns True or False:
```python
a = 200
b = 33

if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
else:
  print("b is not greater than a")  # Prints b is not greater than a
```

### Evaluate Values and Variables
The bool() function allows you to evaluate any value, and give you True or False in return,
```python
print(bool("Hello")) # True
print(bool(15)) # True
```

### Most Values are True
- Almost any value is evaluated to `True` if it has some sort of content.
- Any string is `True`, except empty strings.
- Any number is `True`, except 0.
- Any list, tuple, set, and dictionary are `True`, except empty ones.

### Some Values are False
In fact, there are not many values that evaluate to `False`, except empty values, such as `()`, `[]`, `{}`, `""`, the number `0`, and the value `None`. And of course the value `False` evaluates to `False`.

One more value, or object in this case, evaluates to `False`, and that is if you have an object that is made from a class with a `__len__` function that returns `0` or `False`:

```python
class myclass():
  def __len__(self):
    return 0

myobj = myclass()
print(bool(myobj)) # Prints False
```

### Functions can Return a Boolean
You can create functions that returns a Boolean Value. You can execute code based on the Boolean answer of a function:
```python
def myFunction() :
  return True

if myFunction():
  print("YES!")
else:
  print("NO!")

  # Prints YES!
```

Also, Python also has many built-in functions that return a boolean value, like the isinstance() function, which can be used to determine if an object is of a certain data type:
