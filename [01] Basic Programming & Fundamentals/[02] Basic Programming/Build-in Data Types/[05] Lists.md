## Overview
Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.

### List Basics:
#### Create a List -
Lists are created using square brackets:
```python
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"] 
print(thislist) # ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
```
#### List Items -
List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.

List items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.

#### Ordered -
When we say that lists are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.

If you add new items to a list, the new items will be placed at the end of the list.

**Note:** There are some [list methods](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists_methods.asp) that will change the order, but in general: the order of the items will not change.

#### Allow Duplicates -
Since lists are indexed, lists can have items with the same value. Example:
```python
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple", "cherry"] # ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'apple', 'cherry']
print(thislist)
```

#### List Length -
To determine how many items a list has, use the len() function:
```python
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(len(thislist)) # 3
```
#### List Items - Data Types
List items can be of any data type:

Example: `String`, `int` and `boolean` data types:
```python
list1 = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
list2 = [1, 5, 7, 9, 3]
list3 = [True, False, False]
```
A list can contain `different data types`. Example
A list with strings, integers and boolean values:
```python
list1 = ["abc", 34, True, 40, "male"]
```

#### type() - 
From Python's perspective, lists are defined as objects with the data type 'list': `print(type(mylist)) ----> <class 'list'>`

#### The list() Constructor -
It is also possible to use the list() constructor when creating a new list.
```python
thislist = list(("apple", "banana", "cherry")) # note the double round-brackets
print(thislist) # ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
```

### Access List Items:
#### Access Items -
List items are indexed and you can access them by referring to the index number:
```python
# Print the second item of the list:

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(thislist[1]) # banana
``` 
`Note: The first item has index 0.`

#### Negative Indexing -
Negative indexing means start from the end. `-1` refers to the last item, `-2` refers to the second last item etc.
```python
#Print the last item of the list:

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(thislist[-1]) # cherry
```
#### Range of Indexes -
You can specify a range of indexes by specifying where to start and where to end the range. When specifying a range, the return value will be a new list with the specified items.
```python
# Return the third, fourth, and fifth item:

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange", "kiwi", "melon", "mango"]
print(thislist[2:5]) # ['cherry', 'orange', 'kiwi']
```

`Note: The search will start at index 2 (included) and end at index 5 (not included).`

By leaving out the start value, the range will start at the first item:
```python
# This example returns the items from the beginning to, but NOT including, "kiwi":

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange", "kiwi", "melon", "mango"]
print(thislist[:4]) # ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'orange']
```
By leaving out the end value, the range will go on to the end of the list:
```python
# This example returns the items from "cherry" to the end:

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange", "kiwi", "melon", "mango"]
print(thislist[2:]) # ["cherry", "orange", "kiwi", "melon", "mango"]
```

#### Range of Negative Indexes -
Specify negative indexes if you want to start the search from the end of the list:
```python
# This example returns the items from "orange" (-4) to, but NOT including "mango" (-1):

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange", "kiwi", "melon", "mango"]
print(thislist[-4:-1]) # ['orange', 'kiwi', 'melon']
```

#### Check if Item Exists -
To determine if a specified item is present in a list use the `in` keyword:
```python
# Check if "apple" is present in the list:

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
if "apple" in thislist:
  print("Yes, 'apple' is in the fruits list") # Yes, 'apple' is in the fruits list
```
