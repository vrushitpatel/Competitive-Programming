## Python Loops
Python has two primitive loop commands
- `while` loops
- `for` loops

## The while Loop
With the `while` loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.
```python
i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  i += 1
# Output [Everything on new line]: 1 2 3 4 5
```
`Note: remember to increment i, or else the loop will continue forever.`

The `while` loop requires relevant variables to be ready, in this example we need to define an indexing variable, `i`, which we set to 1.

### The break Statement
With the `break` statement we can stop the loop even if the while condition is true:
```python
# Exit the loop when i is 3:
i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  if i == 3:
    break
  i += 1
# Output [Everything on new line]: 1 2 3
```
### The continue Statement
With the `continue` statement we can stop the current iteration, and continue with the next:
```python
# Continue to the next iteration if i is 3:
i = 0
while i < 6:
  i += 1
  if i == 3:
    continue
  print(i)
# Output [Everything on new line]: 1 2 4 5 6
```
### The else Statement
With the else statement we can run a block of code once when the condition no longer is true:
```python
# Print a message once the condition is false:
i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  i += 1
else:
  print("i is no longer less than 6")
# Output [Everything on new line]: 1 2 3 4 5 i is no longer less than 6
```

## For Loops
A `for` loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).

This is less like the `for` keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.

With the `for` loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.

```python
# Print each fruit in a fruit list:

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  print(x)
```
The `for` loop does not require an indexing variable to set beforehand.

### Looping Through a String
Even strings are iterable objects, they contain a sequence of characters:
```python
# Loop through the letters in the word "banana":

for x in "banana":
  print(x)
```

### The break Statement
With the `break` statement we can stop the loop before it has looped through all the items:
```python
# Exit the loop when x is "banana":

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  print(x)
  if x == "banana":
    break
# Output:
#       apple
#       banana
```
```python
# Exit the loop when x is "banana", but this time the break comes before the print:

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  if x == "banana":
    break
  print(x)
# Output: apple
```
### The continue Statement
With the `continue` statement we can stop the current iteration of the loop, and continue with the next:
```python
# Do not print banana:

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  if x == "banana":
    continue
  print(x)
# Output:
#       apple
#       cherry
```

### The range() Function
To loop through a set of code a specified number of times, we can use the `range()` function,

The `range()` function returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 (by default), and ends at a specified number.
```python
# Using the range() function:

for x in range(6):
  print(x)
# Output:
# 0
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4
# 5
```
`Note that range(6) is not the values of 0 to 6, but the values 0 to 5.`
The `range()` function defaults to 0 as a starting value, however it is possible to specify the starting value by adding a parameter: `range(2, 6)`, which means values from 2 to 6 (but not including 6):
```python
# Using the start parameter:

for x in range(2, 6):
  print(x)
# Output:
# 2
# 3
# 4
# 5
```
The `range()` function defaults to increment the sequence by 1, however it is possible to specify the increment value by adding a third parameter: `range(2, 30, 3)`:
```python
# Increment the sequence with 3 (default is 1):

for x in range(2, 30, 3):
  print(x)
# Output:
# 2
# 5
# 8
# 11
# 14
# 17
# 20
# 23
# 26
# 29
```
### Else in For Loop
The `else` keyword in a `for` loop specifies a block of code to be executed when the loop is finished:
```python
# Print all numbers from 0 to 5, and print a message when the loop has ended:

for x in range(6):
  print(x)
else:
  print("Finally finished!")
# Output:
# 0
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4
# 5
# Finally finished!
```

`Note: The else block will NOT be executed if the loop is stopped by a break statement.`

```python
# Break the loop when x is 3, and see what happens with the else block:

for x in range(6):
  if x == 3: break
  print(x)
else:
  print("Finally finished!")
# Output:
# 0
# 1
# 2
```
### Nested Loops
A nested loop is a loop inside a loop.

The "inner loop" will be executed one time for each iteration of the "outer loop":
```python
# Print each adjective for every fruit:

adj = ["red", "big", "tasty"]
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for x in adj:
  for y in fruits:
    print(x, y)
# Output:
# red apple
# red banana
# red cherry
# big apple
# big banana
# big cherry
# tasty apple
# tasty banana
# tasty cherry
```

### The pass Statement
`for` loops cannot be empty, but if you for some reason have a `for` loop with no content, put in the `pass` statement to avoid getting an error.
```python
for x in [0, 1, 2]:
  pass
# Output: <nothing will print>
```
`Note: having an empty for loop like this, would raise an error without the pass statement`
