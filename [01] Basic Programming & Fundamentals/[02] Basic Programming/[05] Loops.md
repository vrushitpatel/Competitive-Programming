## Python Loops
Python has two primitive loop commands
- `while` loops
- `for` loops

## The while Loop
With the `while` loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.
```python
i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  i += 1
# Output [Everything on new line]: 1 2 3 4 5
```
`Note: remember to increment i, or else the loop will continue forever.`

The `while` loop requires relevant variables to be ready, in this example we need to define an indexing variable, `i`, which we set to 1.

### The break Statement
With the `break` statement we can stop the loop even if the while condition is true:
```python
# Exit the loop when i is 3:
i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  if i == 3:
    break
  i += 1
# Output [Everything on new line]: 1 2 3
```
### The continue Statement
With the `continue` statement we can stop the current iteration, and continue with the next:
```python
# Continue to the next iteration if i is 3:
i = 0
while i < 6:
  i += 1
  if i == 3:
    continue
  print(i)
# Output [Everything on new line]: 1 2 4 5 6
```
### The else Statement
With the else statement we can run a block of code once when the condition no longer is true:
```python
# Print a message once the condition is false:
i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  i += 1
else:
  print("i is no longer less than 6")
# Output [Everything on new line]: 1 2 3 4 5 i is no longer less than 6
```
